# Digital Resources

## Websites

* [Bibliotheca Cluniacensis Novissima](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Fruehmittelalter/query.cgi/index/f). The venerable _pater_ of digital Cluny developed at the Institute for the Study of the Middle Ages \(Münster\). 
* [Clunypedia](http://www.clunypedia.com/about). A "Digital Encyclopedia" developed by the Federation of Cluniac Sites \([http://www.sitesclunisiens.org](http://www.sitesclunisiens.org)\). Its most useful feature is the searchable map of Cluniac houses that can be limited by time period. Many houses –once clicked on– provides additional information.
