# The Authors

The major authors we'll be treating:

* Peter the Venerable
* Peter of Poitiers
* Raoul de Sully/ Ralph of Sully
* Raoul Tortarius

I hope to write up short entries for these authors and if complete enough, we can upload them to wikipedia to ensure wider distribution. 

We will likely also attempt to create short biographical records for Peter the Venerable's correspondents, as well as people mentioned in the texts, or authors of texts \(such as Innocent II, recipient and author of papal bulls to Cluny\).
