# Hymn, in honour of Holy Mary Magdalene

Today, great and honoured, shines with the merits of Mary Magdalene

Today a choir of angels and men praise the Lord of Mary

Freed from bodily prison by the brilliance of a celestial light

She departs the shadows and rejoins the celestial dwelling

Christ joins her to him and puts her in the arc of the Creator

Offering hope of forgiveness to the wretched, when merciful, he gave it to Mary

Indeed she – weeping so greatly – washed the feet of the Lord with her tears

By them, washing away all her sins and in crying, expiating all her vain pleasures

She merited to dry his feet with her hair and no less deserved to anoint them

She gave kisses to the feet of the lord and the Lord gave to her forgiveness

Therefore, entreat God, Mary, when you bring to him our entreaties,

Unburdening ...

And he assents to the prayers of the people, He himself mindful of your service

Offering the joys of the heavenly crowd and granting a good enduring without end

Glory to you pious Christ, and to you Spirit and to God the Father

Who lifting Mary above the stars, established her a peer among the heaven-born.
