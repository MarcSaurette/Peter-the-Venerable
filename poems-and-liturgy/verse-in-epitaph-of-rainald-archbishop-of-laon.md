# Verse in epitaph of Rainald, Archbishop of Laon

This leader Renald lies with the glory of the pontiffs, 

...

First as Abbot of Vezelay, then as the Patriarch

Of Laon he burned brightly, made the honour of honour.

Heavenly gifts, treasures and ranks speak,

...

...

...

Whose monk he was, near whose breast he was born,

He slept in your lap, O Cluny,

He whom committed to you, commit to the number of the pious

And with your prayers let him reach heaven.
