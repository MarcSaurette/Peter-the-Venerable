# A rhythmic verse, on the resurrection of our Lord

The Strong has done violence to the gates of the dead

He struck down their cruel duke

He shone bright light on the dwelling place of shadows,

When he wished to save and remake what he had made

The Creator, therefore, died, so that a sinner need not die

By His death, a new life arose for us in our destiny

Satan, completely vanquished, sighs since the Victor has redeemed us

For he was the reason of the death of that which is life-giving to humans[\[1\]](applewebdata://784F497F-FB89-465F-BF70-AA3DEE610B56#_ftn1)

It was caught when it took, and died when it destroyed.

HE suffered because the captives were freed from the prison of Hell, 

HE who is accustomed to spare no one.

So pleasingly, So powerfully, the King triumphed over the infernal regions

Leaving the abyss on the first day \[of the week\], and returned to the Heavens.

He was resurrected and God gave to humanity a new life with Him

By repairing the original condition which he had granted when creating them

Through the passion of the Author, the first citizen now returns to the region

Once lost to him, whence this song may be so joyful.
