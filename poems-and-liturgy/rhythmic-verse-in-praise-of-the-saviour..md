# Rhythmic verse in praise of the Saviour.

Sent by the father, born in the world, God of a Virgin

He experienced human life, he taught and he died, freely for man

Through the wood \[of the cross\] our mortality obtained that death be denied

The lost dignity was returned to the world by the constraints of the wood

The fruit of the tree of death is consumed, by which life is lost

Blood which is taken in faith, flows from the body of Christ,

The Serpent is killed, the world is redeemed by the payment of blood

This drink brings death to him, but confers life on us

The Exile, cast out from his own fatherland dwells in the world

Who swelling with impious pride, did not wish to subject himself to God

From whose worldly trials, the clement God grieves

On account of which he wished that his son endure the suffering of death

And He sent from his own throne, next He clothed \[him\] in flesh

In which though beaten and crucified, nothing diminished in God

He did not linger long, but immediately brought back life from death

Marvellous Work! to which no divine gift is the like

Adam was ejected, the thief was led back, What a marvelous change!

Then first it became clear how the passion of the creator profited the world

 He left the cross; mortality obtained…

...

Every victory of the king explored the hiding places of death

With a mighty power he broke the strong chains of the sinners

Christ the Victor bore this, his plunder, from Hell after the battle

This he took into the rejoincing heavenly cities above

Three days had passed, forming life in the bodily death

...

Then the world grew fearful, the afraid did penance and expiated their sins

He appeared henceforth to his \[people\] fearing and losing hope

And he showed himself visible and tangeable to them

But not to those admiring, those believing for the reason of joy

He demonstrated to the gathering that he truly lived, that he wore flesh

They immediately acknowledged that he as the Lord who had risen again

And did not hesitate to believe whom they saw to live, as he had predicted

Afterwards enough, the Creator of light poured out into the lands of man

He prepared to ascend, and with him to bring what thence he had obtained

But before those faithful witnesses, ordering them to undertake things

He selected a family, he commanded that they spread out from B

So that by the disciples, the virtue of such a miracle be made famous

Among the people, and it subject to himself the swelling of the world

...

Through the son of God, he merited to assume the paternal throne

I urge that you not mourn, MAN, but rejoice what he bore to the heavens

What more marvelous, what more sublime is brought out into God

...

And you, O Highest Ones, 

But with new associates, with impious expelled, learn to rejoice

He showed to you then the great miracle, the great vent of the spirit?

God, with his covering of flesh, appeared covered for man

This new order, man raised up by the highest spirits

We marvel at worthily, lest we scorn good intentions

...

O what do you admire? He whom you see to rise to the heavens

Descends again to consider the causes of all labours

Just as the ascension, so is the regression made, when justice…

...

Christ, my God, I cry to you, whom I hope as judge

That I will feel then your clemency, not anger \(the punisher of the wicked\)

Then when you sit on your great throne with a judgement prepared,

You will place the sheep to the right, the goats to the other side

Then to the final sheep, You greatest Shepherd, do not deny that place

And do not separate me, I ask, from those happy flocks.

Be mindful of the Cluniac sheep in so great a crowd

And Benign Lord, lead them to a perpetual pasture

Your voice plunges into the secret places of the flaming well

Satan with his lost, passed into the pasture of sulphurous fire

Afterwards, clothe the…

And return the Christian inhabitants of the world to the heavens.

This which you promised and which for a long time you hid, then revealed

When God is seen the greatest without end by men. 

Amen
