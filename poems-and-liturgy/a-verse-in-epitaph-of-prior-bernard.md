# A verse in epitaph of Prior Bernard

Distinguished senior, in whom nothing juvenile remained

Bernard, our prior, rests buried in earth

He, after his fighting service, rising unto the celestial castle,

Grew old, stuggling long here in a public contest.

He never restrained himself for you, O Cluny, 

There was not a day that he was not labouring for you 

Thus, tolerating well the burden of the whole day,

May he, exalting, bear back so late the merited reward 

YOU BROTHERS, be mindful of the buried of yours

And do not die in the spirit when the earth covers your bones.
