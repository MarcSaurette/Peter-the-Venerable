# Another Hymn about the translation and coming of this Father Benedict

O Gaul, Rejoice greatly with loud songs,

Be gladdened by the bones of Father Benedict

Happy are you to watch over these renowned limbs,

Now held at your bosom.



He once illuminated Italy with his miraculous actions

And now he enlightens the Gauls with his mortal body

He shines forth with frequent signs at his tomb

Adding luster to his new fatherland.



He thereby revives the deeds of ancient prophets

In death, he commands the dead as he wishes

Through his own bones he awakens the deceased

O what marvellous power!



A ship without an oarsman navigates the river

With miraculus momentum, it breaks the ice 

Bearing the saintâ€™s limbs against the flow of the river

It beat back the waves behind.



When dry land perceives that it has landed

Not worrying about the cold of the icy season

It immediately clothes every place with new flowers

With the appearance of the countryside remade.



O greatest father, now residing in heaven, 

Instruct your servants in the divine rules

Bestowing on them the means to ascend by that narrow path

Grant them the eternal kingdom. 



O Omnipotence, ruling over all

You who see all things from the seat on heaven

Receive these songs of those peacefully singing

These songs pledged with the voice and sworn &lt;in the heart&gt;. Amen.
