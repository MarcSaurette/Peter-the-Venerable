# A rhythmic verse on Saint Hugh, abbot of Cluny

Hugh, our pious father, illustrious in lineage

Shines even more brightly by grace of his virtues

When he lay hidden, still enclosed in his mother’s womb, 

A priest sacrified eucharist for the boy

The proof of a great miracle –an image of this little one – 

Is glimpsed in the chalice,

If anyone wonders what meaning I interpret, it is thus

The offering \[hostia\] foretold what would be offered \[hostiam\]

Then this boy was birthed and born was nursed

He overtook men in the ranking of age

Adequately \[endowed\] with youthful corporeal powers

He strove in the virtues with burning zeal.

He despised the world, and all its joys

Recognizing that all things quickly perish

He renounced the world, and allied himself to God

Thus fleeing the earth, he drew near the heavens.

Afterwards, inspired by the divine spirit

With the heart changed, he was changed in habit

He remained within the Lord’s sheepfold

A sheep of Christ exceptional with his sheep

He sedulously obeyed the commands of the Shepherd

Nothing of them commanded what the Rule ordered

With a vigourous exertion he trampled pride under foot

Conquering malice by his wisdom.

He received a sainted meal of justice

And followed in the footsteps of the poverty of Christ

Growing in virtue as time advanced

He seemed admirable by old men.

Now dead to the world, he showed that he lived with Christ

To mortals by his saintly work

Hence the shepherd died, the sheep was placed in command

And strenuously he accomplished the succession of the shepherd

He taught those subjected to him by words and acts

Offering himself as the image of good works to all

Fierce towards crimes, mercifully

Combining both, he was made an equitable mediator.

As a prudent doctor annoits a patient/ an illness

Which health casts off, he excises the rotten flesh.

A superior seat did not puff him up

Who in mind remained inferior to all.

The master of the meek, the father of the humble

He located his humility here, while in a place of such exalted things

 His sanctity was increased by a gift of the Spirit

He was the perfection of the law, he did not lack charity

Paupers were fed through the most willing intention

That which were given, God gave with a most generous hand

He clothed the nudity of Christ, or of paupers

The amount of good works grew even larger.

This venerable man of the Cluniacs

Enriched the monastary more than the early fathers

The religious way of life grew under his zeal

He augmented as well, the number of the brothers in the community \(college\)

The Lord expanded this house with things

Thus he showed how greatly he loved Hugh

The blessed servitude furnishing so great a reward

While he served, the man subjugated to God commanded.

Not only was he content with practical zeal \(learning\)

He strove in the leisure of the theoretical life

He carefully fulfilled the \(office\) responsibility of Martha

He heard the conversation of Christ like Mary.

Like Leah, he multiplied the sons of God

Whom he devotedly applied to the \(cultivations\) learning of God

Like Rachel, barren but with a beautiful face

He probed with a subtle heavenly sight.

Reading was yoked to everflowing silence

Nor did fervent prayer lack in tears, 

He consecrated this by frequent sacrifice

While he consecrated this, he became the Host.

This I add more to his works

Since they shine more than all the stars

For his works are as if stars

Which in number remain infinite.
