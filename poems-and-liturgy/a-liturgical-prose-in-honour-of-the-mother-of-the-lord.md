# A liturgical prose, in honour of the Mother of the Lord

Alleluia, from a joyful voice, Truth, from the earth

Is born, since Christ was born of flesh

A new glory is made in the heavens, new rejoicing is done on Earth

The Author of All is come, who takes pity on mortal creatures

And now He has proven his pledge of freedom from the captivity of the enemy,

The Heavens bathed the earth with showers, the earth produced the Saviour

A choir of Angels sang when their King was made infant

That virginal womb, an enclose chosen by God, is made fertile by the Spirit

And as the branch produces a flower, the virgin produced our Redeemer, clothed in a habit of flesh, 

The Infant God was fed by the holy milk of a mother unsullied, a thing so marvellous in the world. 

He lived on strange foods, by which all things remained wholeâ€“ a thing not equaled by another miracle.

He was reared on a human diet, which gave life to the flesh.

The womb of the mother carried him and the seat of the Father

The Virgin consolder her son, and venerated him as God

Emmanuel is with us, Saviour of Israel

The mind, the voice, the eyes of the Christian people

Receive you, Mother; through you they desire to have your son 

As a certain and propitious refuge.

Therefore, Liege Lady of the World, direct your tender light to forgiving our sins

Put evil to flight and render justice, by the grace of Jesus Christ.
