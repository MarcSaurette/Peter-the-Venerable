# Another liturgical prose in honour of the Mother of Our Lord

Heaven, rejoice! Earth, clap your hands! Let none mute his praise.

Man returns to his ancient state through the Virgin

The Virgin gives birth to God and, as a result, the longstanding strife has its end

Longstanding discord has its end and peace and glory follow.

The guilty arise from the mire, when God lays down in the hay \[of the manger\].

A lowly stable conceals the fodder of a heavenly meal.

The Virgin feeds the Creator, who, through her, becomes our Redeemer.

Divine wisdom lies hidden underneath his childish appearance

The motherâ€™s breasts pour out milk, the flesh of the Son pours milk

And this grants the sweetness of grace by assuming humanity

Therefore we sing a sweet melody, O Mary,

With pious voices and our expressed emotions

Hail, blessed Virgin! You who have put to flight all that is evil

Hail, Mother on High, Wife of the softest lamb.

You have triumphed over the serpent, whose head you crushed

When God was born of you, it was his death.

You, Empress of the Heavens, You, the healer of the Earth

Whom men long for, whom evil demons fear

You, the window, the door, the fleece, the palace, the home, the temple, the field

The lily of virginity and the rose of martyrdom

The walled garden, the font of gardens washing the dirt of sinners

Purifying the iniquitous and giving life to the dead

Liege Lady of the Angels; after God, the hope of the world

Throne of a king and seat of a Diety

Shining Star of the East, who puts to flight shadows in the West

Aurora, who proceeds the son, and Day who never knows night

O You! Parent of our parent and Mother to he who gives birth to us

With the courage of a pious mother, unite your children to the Father

Pray, O Mother, to the God born man that he forgive our sins

And after having given us his pardon, that he grants us his Grace and Glory.

Amen.
