# 184. to Galcher, the cellarer of Clairvaux \(March, 1151\)

To my beloved brother and son Galcher, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of the Cluniacs wishes complete salutation from the Saviour.

Since, you are not now a new friend, but one for many years, I do not labour before you in speaking, nor do I employ a long insinuation to get at that which I intend. For he who is a friend, does not expect entreaties, but the wish of a friend. This, as he acknowledges, he should labour to impliment immediately. This is my wish, that the brother Nicholas spend Easter with us. Now you know what I want. It is henceforth your \[mission/ obligation\] that I do not wish in vain, or that I write without end. I asked your lord abbot for this. If it is necessary, may you also ask.
