# 38. to Peter, the Archbishop of Lyons \(1131/ 9\)

To the one so venerable and preeminent among the members of the body of Christ, lord Peter, the archprelate of the holy church of Lyons, brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny, wishes a spirit of debate and courage.

I entreat, therefore, at the end of this letter, your love \(cherished by every cockle of my heart and so very sweet to me\) that, now that your burdens are a little lessened, you may also give space for the letters of a friend anxious about you in this matter and make provision, in addition, for an hour devoted to reading studiously.
