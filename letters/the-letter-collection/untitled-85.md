# 166. a Response of the Lord Abbot to him \[Suger of Saint-Dénis\] \(1150\)

To the venerable and our heart’s friend, the lord Suger abbot of Saint-Dénis, the brother Peter the humble abbot of the Cluniacs wishes an abundance of salubrity both present and eternal.

I am grieved, and I am grieved more than I am able to say, since I am not able to attend your sacred assembly, which the lord king proclaimed at Chartres in accordance with your and others’ wise counsel. Believe an intimate friend, believe one speaking the truth that truly I wish it, but I am unable; and since I am unable, I am grieved. For who is not grieved that he cannot attend so sacred an assembly where none looks for his own gain, where none looks for what is his, but only what is for Jesus Christ.
