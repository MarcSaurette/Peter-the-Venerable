# 86. the Response of Abbot Peter to the Bishop Hato \(1141\)

To the beloved and ever revered with love by me, lord Hato, bishop of Troyes, brother Peter humble abbot of the Cluniacs, sends greetings…

These things should be avoided, it seems to me my beloved friend, not embraced; blessed rest must be put before labour, security before fear, safety before dangers; 

May the paradise of charity await you at your Cluny before the paradise of desire, where the tree of life, where pleasant attraction, where
