# 1. To Pope Innocent \(1137\)

To the highest shepherd of the Church of God and our special father, the Lord Pope Innocent, the brother Peter, humble abbot of Cluny, makes a prayer of most devout humility.

...

fervent with great love towards you ...

And since he \[ the Archbishop of Bordeaux\] reports that you expend considerable labour that you apply yourself with complete zeal, that you do not refuse any danger of work for reforming the peace of the Church of God, I am moved in my soul to writing to you since I am unable to work with you in person.

...

Count on this, since the whole church committed to you by God, and I, the last of the members of Christ, and equally your Cluny \(who for so long was the spirit in our nostrils\) are prepared for obeying, for collaborating, and even, perchance, for dying together. Certainly no change of changeable things will change us, no differing circumstances will make a difference, nothing is able to separate us from the shepherd, from Peter, from Christ which all we consider as one in you.

...

Let us remind that the church always grew by labours, that it was multiplied by sufferings, that toleration conquered every resistence.

...
