# 186. To Basil, the Prior of the Carthusians \(1151\)

To my most beloved and especially to be embraced Basil, lord of the servants of God and prior of la Chartreuse, brother Peter, the humble abbot of the Cluniacs, wishes eternal salvation for him devoted to him.

Implore immediately the mercy of the Omnipotent God since, my beloved, they are not offered at present, in order that they may at least be granted in the future. My journey, and the companions of my trip, as I entrust to a special and intimate friend, which the more help is lacking, the more the dangers in this time of winter are formidable. For my part, I pray that you welcome brother Peter of Gap \(formerly in the army of Christ, as I myself witnessed, of Tiron, now a veteran\), Geoffrey \(who fought the good fight for so long and now has almost finished his rotation\) and that you attentively commend both me and ours of a holy life in your prayers.
