# 79. A response of Peter to him \(1131/43\)

To the singular and intimate lord of mine and, by the grace of God, a friend, the preeminent pontiff of the Church of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, the brother Peter, humble abbot of the Cluniacs sends greetings.

It is true. It is true what Truth said, they do not gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. But on the other hand it is also true, that they did not gather thorns from a vine nor thistles from a fig-tree. I experienced in your letters what I say: I was able to draw nothing but oil from an olive, nothing but honey from a beehive, nothing but milk from a full udder. Words should be doubted unless they are preceded by deeds. A friendly soul does not buy friends with naked affection, friends to whom one is accustomed to grant less with the mouth, more with the heart, less with words, more in deeds.
