# 56. To the same \(1135\)

To the most beloved lord and intimate friend, the venerable lord bishop Henry, the brother Peter, humble abbot of the Cluniacs wishes present and eternal salubrity.

He observes, I believe, your intention with the pious eyes of his mercy, and though it does not necessarily have to be covered by any garment, nonetheless it is loved with devotion of saintly service, since â€¦

already dead and risen on his cross, he does not recuse yours which for that ointment, is more precious 

But we are able to repay nothing so great to you, nothing worthy of such great love, nothing equal to such benefits, except this, because everything we are is yours, everything we know is yours and everything we are capable of is yours. This shows in all the communities of our Church on all our friends and benefactors,
