# 193. To his Nicholas \(1152\)

 “To live, I say, is not that which , thanks to god, happens to me in contrarity. But because one who “chevauche” all day, who stops at midnight to eat, who departs very early in the morning and who exists within perpectual combat, he does not have anymore the heart for meditation and cannot prepare either his tongue to speak or his hand to write”

deplores that men of his time do not study anymore, don’t read enough
