# 2. To Matthew of Albano \(1134/35\)

Hearing your messangers, reading your letters, recognizing your indefatigable love towards us, I blush that I am unable to repay something worthy of so much affection, I recognize that I cannot return something sufficient of such charity.

_caritate non ficta_\(p. 5\)

For if it should be done otherwise, and he permits so great a church to be perverted by so vile a man, he will disturb his Cluniacs more than I am able to say at present, because reverence of his majesty is called salvation. The abbot of Bonneval \(which is next to _Carnotum_\) with many honest and wise men, as he asserted, decided to come to Cluny, if by the counsel of Your Wisdom, he was able to receive the permission of leaving from the Lord Pope.
