# 101. to Pope Innocent \(1141\)

Just as Solomon said, a friend is not known in good times and nor is an enemy hidden in bad, so also do these things reveal an enemy to your enemies in this time of schism, with the result that it is almost unnecessary that we commend him for his fidelity and friendship; the great tumults of tempests and tornadoes make it know that  he is proven a most faithful and devoted foster son.

\[in reference to newly elected bishop, Arnulf of Liseux\]
