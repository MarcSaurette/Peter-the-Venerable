# 22. to Hato, bishop of Troyes \(1128/46\)

To the venerable and most loved by us Lord Hato bishop of Troyes, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny wishes a plenitude of salubrity and love.

I marvel, if I was able to rise in the heart of so equanimous a friend, that our mutual love is esteemed so little by me that I have seen your letters and have responded nothing to them. This ought not be thought at all by Your sublime person about My humility, from whom, as I imagine, life will be able to depart before that charity \(which binds you and I\) grows lukewarm in one of us. I heard indeed that those letters had been conveyed by a certain someone, but upon investigating everything carefully, I was unable either to see the letters or to uncover their conveyor. The reason of not responding, therefore, is more able to be imputed to one sending carelessly. For if things had been sent with proper precautions, then they hardly would have lain unseen by our eyes. Now, since it is foolish to cure the healthy or repair the undamaged, it is no more necessary to spend time adding or sparing words about the love between us, which presently, as I see it, is impossible to expand and which in no way, with the grace of God helping, is able to be diminished from your status. Of the other things which a little while ago you wrote a response, we enjoin brother Hugh, our chamberlain. Question and listen to him since we sent him to your parts in regards to the present matter.
