# 132. to the Carthusians \(1137/43\)

To those venerable and beloved to us, the lord prior of the Carthusians and other brothers, brother Peter, humble abbot of Cluny, wishes the same salvation which was wished to him.

The lord prior Guido –of pious and holy memory– did not write thusly, not so that I would lay aside some of the familiar quarrels among family members, but in the epistolary manner, after the introductory salutation, he aptly indicated the affection of a kind heart with the following words. But perhaps you feared to be verbose with us, and in order that we would not be verbose ourselves, we advise with great brevity. Perhaps you thought, even if you did not say it, what saint Job said to his friends, My friends are wordy, my eye pours out tears to God. But to say something figuratively or literally,  I respond to both, since it cleaves so greatly to the affection of my soul, if you always spoke, you would seem to be taciturn, if I always spoke to you, I would seem mute to myself.
