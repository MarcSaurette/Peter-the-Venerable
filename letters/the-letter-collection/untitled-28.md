# 97. to Pope Innocent

To the highest pontiff and our special father, the lord pope Innocent, brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny sends obedience and love.

If I should say something less wisely, I ask that paternal piety forgive it. For perhaps it is possible to be ineptitude, but it is not able to be indevote to you. I beseach the apostolic benignity on behalf of the lord king of France, your great, and noble and special son that since not only he is king, not only is he the mangificent ruler of the Christian people, but also  …

\[king opposes the election of certain figure…\]

Furthermore, I make know that the monastery of Luxueil for which you wished to provide in a former year through our Cluniac brothers, and truly you provided but a brief time, 

\[and now the monks have fallen even further…\] loss of religion and observances.. 

What more might I say? The whole head is tired and the whole heart is faint. From the sole of the foot to the top of the head, there is not health in it. Let the father provide for his sons.
