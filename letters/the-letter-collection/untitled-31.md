# 94. to the monk Gregory

In certain places where affairs call me, in all our houses and even in the most remote corners, I find Gregory with semons, Gregory with letters, Gregory with treatises, with a piece of books or manuscripts. I see him thusly always and everywhere surrounded: his robe is full, his knees buckle under their weight. It would be difficult to find at Cluny a philosopher superior to those of the ancient academy.
