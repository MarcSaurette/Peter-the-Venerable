# 96. the Response of Bishop Hato to him \(1141\)

To the abbot of Cluny, his bishop of Troyes sends the same which was sent to him.

And behold, the letter of a friend enters the hands of a friend. I am wildly passionate that I myself

my rejoicing eyes have the full enjoyment of the desired pages, I am stunned, I confess, both at the sweetness of the letter and at the extirpation of affairs, which suppressed with so golden a mouth. Truly the king returned, the racket of arms has grown silent, the clemency of the air is fragrant, but the harvests are not squirreled away into storehouses, since the harvesters have been unable to find them. Hope was in their eyes, but behold, grief was in their hands, since the storm sent by God harvested the surface of our land.
