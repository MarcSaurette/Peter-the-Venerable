# 50. To Stephen, a Cleric of Lyons \(1132/36\)

My soul now does not know to rest about yours, as about itself, incited by its meditating, speaking, and writing about its salvation. You have begun, my beloved, you have begun to run, you must not slacken. All run, but only one receives the prize. Therefore run so you might attain it. See, let not an evil criminal impede your journey. For you did not begin to descend from Jerusalem to Jericho but to ascend from Jericho to Jerusalem. The descent to Avernus is easy, as one \[Virgil\] said, But to retrace the stops and to escape back to the upper airs: that is toil, that is hardship. What am I getting at? …

Come to me soon, just as I talked with you about, and I re-requested afterwards, so that if there are still things to be talked about and things to be fulfilled, they may be talked about and fulfilled. …
