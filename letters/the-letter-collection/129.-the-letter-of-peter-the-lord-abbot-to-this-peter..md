# 129. The letter of Peter, the lord Abbot, to this Peter.

To the venerable brother and beloved son Peter, brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny, sends greetings, grace and benediction.

No matter where my journey stretches, still you are always with me. This is a miracle. A lame man accompanies those scurrying around and he is not absent from them for even a brief instant. This occurs in mind but not in body, by affect not effect, by charity not association. Indeed you are at rest and we consumed by business, but despite your rest, we have no wish to be restful at all. All of our dearest things we do not bring with us, we are accustomed to leave with you. The books –especially those of Augustine as you know– are more precious to us than gold. Those trifles I wrote are perhaps no less dear. On account of this, therefore, we interrupt your rest and we do not want that it to be completely spent at rest; therefore you should send to us one of the books by Augustine as a comfort for our most laborious journey, and also our letters and the life of the lord bishop Matthew, since the book written against the heretics fails to be as it was conceived and produced in my own heart.
