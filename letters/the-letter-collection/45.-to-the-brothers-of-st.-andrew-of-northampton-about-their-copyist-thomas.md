# 45. to the Brothers of St. Andrew of Northampton, about their Copyist Thomas

Since we love according to the communal debt of charity all belonging to the body of the Cluniac congregation we embrace you among the others with a certain special affection. And although we have never seen your location in its physical aspect, nontheless we watch over you, not only daily, but continuously, with a look of true love. The fame of your excellent way of life makes this so, but especially your brother Thomas, or rather, our brother Thomas, because even if you are personally lacking, nonetheless from him, you possess us and all our things. For he is an intimate of ours, and so much beloved in Christ that while your England has often sent innumerable gifts to Cluny, nothing ever so ever enriched Cluny so freely and so dearly. Therefore, let not his absence weigh down on youâ€¦
