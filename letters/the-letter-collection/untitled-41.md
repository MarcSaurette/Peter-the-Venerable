# 80. to the brothers at Mont Thabor

To the brothers serving God at Mont Thabor, honoured and venerably taken up in the charity of Christ, the brother Peter, humble abbot of Cluniacs, wishes eternal salvation.

A certain brother of your community, so he said, recently travelling for the sake of prayer, so he claimed, through parts of France and Spain, dressed in the habit of a pilgrim, made a trip to us, and he raised our spirits in no little measure by telling us about your status, about your customs, and about the zeal of your religious way of life, which until now had been unknown to us. The affection of our hearts grew so much greater –or indeed all our love became completely united towards your sanctity– when he reported not only our common faith, not only our common monastic profession, but that you are united with our body in recent times through the careful observance of the Cluniac customs. Therefore we rejoice in the Lord that in that land where we received the salvation of faith and faith of salvation, we poured back some manner of good works even if not by us, still by ours. You also should rejoice, if some crops grow from the seed which you planted, if you are able to reap some fruit from the saplings planted by you. For, as the great apostle said, “…”.

By the grace of the heavenly donor,

And since that sound sounds forth in the whole world, and penetrates those most remote ends of the world and narrow extents, where it first sounded, it dares to resonate clearly, where first it was heard, it ought to be heard positively quickly and for a long time…

May you pray for us \(we praying for you\) so that faith and charity which joins us here to you so remote and unseen, link together eternally through the grace of the lord God and the gift of his spirit, those to be co-conquering and to be born together.
