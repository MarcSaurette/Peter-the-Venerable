# 88. to Henry, Bishop of Winchester \(1129/56\)

To the venerable and revered with the joyful memory of the heart, lord Henry, bishop of Winchester, brother Peter humble abbot of the Cluniacs wishes the salvation that God has prepared for those Him.

When your reverence \(to be much embraced\) recently left from Cluny, my tongue remained mute to you, but my conscience did not keep quiet about you. An allocution was silenced, but not devotion; locution was lukewarm, but charity was not rendered frigid. Do not marvel at this. For since almost all friends of the Cluniac sheepfold, since all the providers, since all the benefactors come together as one in you, it should not be astonishing if our love formerly divided amongst the many rally to you alone. But since we consider that this remains certain in you, words need not be multiplied about this, and need not repeat disdainfully what we rightly know.
