# 95. To Hato, Bishop of Troyes \(1141\)

To his bishop of Troyes, a humble brother sends what is accustomed.

Behold the king returned. the dukes sworn to Mars revisit their domestic hearths, the bellicose machinery has grown quiet, none compels the bishop to fight, the heat of the summer \(which is feared\) flees, autumnal temperateness is pleasing in its progress, harvests are squirreled away in storehouses, fresh wine ferments in vats, no necessity of the home, not care of the republic impedes the trip of a friend to a friend.
