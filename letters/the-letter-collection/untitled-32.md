# 91. To Pontius, Abbot of VÃ©zelay \(1138/56\)

And so, I say to a sleeping brother not willing to keep awake from a long sleep for his brother, nor for his brothers: so great and so long a feud was put to rest, by my, I repeat my, effort, by my care, by my constant concern \(with the grace of God leading and helping\); and our brothers Heraclius and Eustace are now sworn by inviolable oaths in perpetual federation and friendship.
