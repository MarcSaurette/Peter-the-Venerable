# 42. a response of Lord Peter to Prior Theodard \(1132/36\)

To the Venerable and Lord Prior Theodard, an intimate of ours and the Community of La Charit√©, beloved to us, brother Peter, the humble abbot of the Cluniacs, sends a plenitude of complete salutation, grace and blessing.

Intently we read and reread you letters, which exilerated our heart with joy as much as it sounded you rejoicing.
