# 138. to Peter, Abbot of St. Augustine at Limoges \(1137/56\)

You have not imitated certain men of our times who, raised to the title of abbot or honoured with the episcopal dignity, removed themselves from us in spirit, as they they were obliged to do in the body, rejecting the affection of theirs, and rejoicing as if had come to be freed from the yoke of the monastic life. Those will see with what state of the soul they serve God, since they seem humble, those who, under the pretext of governing the Church , dare to take themselves back from God to give themselves to the world. These are not the servants of God, but just as these men, for whom the liberte had been covered with a veil of malice, they bustle about with a pause and run to all place, as if they obtained finally what they had desired for so long. They forget their family and meet with none but strangers. They do not think, anymore, about the cloister to where they came long ago, where they remained and from where they finally departed. You, however, beloved brother, do not undertake yourself so. You prefer always our things to yours, and you endeavour always for triumphing the interest of Cluny. Upon a single sign from us or ours, you put first our interests above those of our adversaries.
