# 162. to the King of Sicily

To the magnificent prince, the lord Roger, king of Sicily, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny, wishes present health and eternal kingship.

Let He who knows all know how greatly we love your sublimity, how much we wish your acts \(both in the lord and in the world\) to prosper. Truly we were pained hearing the death of your sons and both for your healthy sons as for the souls of those others, we commanded that masses be celebrated, that prayers to God overflow and alms to be offered within our convent. But not only just then, but also we often will repeat the memory of you, among our other kings, friends and benefactors, at the many solemn days and our major chapters.

I see no other Christian prince under Heaven by whom so well, so equally, so efficiently as by you this work –so sacred, so befitting heaven and earth– is able to be fulfilled. For by the grace of God \(which I do not say as an adorer\) … in comparison to other princes, you are wiser in thought, richer in gifts, more practiced in virtue and above all closer to that place. Therefore, good prince, rise up… rise up in aid of the people of God…
