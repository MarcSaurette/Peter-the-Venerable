# 115. to Abbess Eloise \(1143/44\)

To the venerable and much beloved in Christ sister abbess Eloise, brother Peter, humble abbot of the Cluniacs wishes salvation which God promised to those loving him.

After having received your charityâ€™s letter \(which you recently sent to me through my son Theobald\), I rejoiced and embraced them amicably with the thanks of a correspondent. I wished immediately to write back what lay in my soul, but I could not, since the unfortunate demands of other concerns prevented this, demands to which frequently \(or rather almost always\) I am compelled to submit. I had scarcely attained what I had planned due to the considerable demands that day, It seemed that I should hasten to repay a return \(of words at least\) for your affection towards me \(which I had recognized both then from your letter and first from gifts sent to me\) and that I should demonstrate how greatly in my heart I maintained for you a place of love in the lord. For in truth I begin to love \(not now for the first time\) one whom I recollect to have love for a long time.
