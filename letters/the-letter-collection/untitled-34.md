# 89. to Albero, Bishop of Liège \(1136/45\)

For though we owe honor and at the same time love \(amor\) through the framework of charity to all the churches of Christ, which in their numerousness, make up the body of the one and catholic Church, among all the churches of Germany we owe this to you on account of a certain familial privilege; not only by whose love are we encouraged but also by whose frequent bequests and great gifts we are incited magnificently to rebalance the mutual exchange of goodwill \(benevolentiae\).  

But we especially beg your friendship for the lord Gerard, the prior of Bertrée and the house committed to him; who is well deserving of this, we believe, not only for his noble birth \(which is well known to you\) but also for the honest manner of his life \(for which he is commended by us\).
