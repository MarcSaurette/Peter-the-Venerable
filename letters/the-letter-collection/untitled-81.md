# 174. to Pope Eugenius \(1145/33\)

To the highest pontiff and our special father, the lord Pope Eugenius, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of the Cluniacs sense owed obedience with filial love.

Your Apostolic sollicitude hears often many things born out of the orb of the lands from many peopleâ€¦

There are many things which show to be true what I say except I fear that in being long I will seem too excessive to you.
