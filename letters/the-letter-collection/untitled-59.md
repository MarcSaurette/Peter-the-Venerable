# 120. To Rainard,  Cisterican abbot. \(1134/50\)

To the venerable and greatly to be embraced in Christ lord Rainard, abbot of Cîteraux, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny sends salutation and affection filled of charity.

The flock of the lord, the sheep of his pasture, those lost to the shepherd through the highness of the mountains, the sloping vallies, through the narrow trails, requiring great labour from the pastor recently came to us at Cluny on the sollemn day of the Holy Spirit. We are compassionate, as is just, to religious on pilgrimege and we compeeled those greatly tired from the trip to remain as our guests for three days. ….

 they came on feet not horses or mules…

I ensured they got every attention… they are much beloved by me…
