# 183. to Philip the Prior of Clairvaux (March, 1151)

To the honourable and beloved brother, the lord prior Philip of Clairvaux, the brother Peter, the humble abbbot of Cluny sends love and salutation.

Soloman said, A new friend is like new wine, let it grow old and with sweetness you will drink it. Thusly, brother, do you seem to be to me. I give thanks to God that you are a new friend. I place hope in this, namely that you will grow old in friendship and you, who pleases me as a new friend, will please me so much the more when having grown old. For the longer sincere love \[continues] the sweeter it is accustomed to be.[\[1\]](applewebdata://AECA5F8B-282A-45F0-965D-D9329729B55A#\_ftn1)Always it is pleasing to me from which I see that you are yours, and your peaceful and benign manners recommend you, so that I love you greatly. Command therefore from now on what you might wish to one ready to obey. You must also obey according to the law commanding friendship. I asked the lord abbot that he send to me before the feast, his and your Nicholas. Make a case before him so that he does what I petition\
