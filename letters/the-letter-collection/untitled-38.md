# 83. to the Patriarch of Jerusalem

To the venerable and most beloved to us lord patriarch of Jerusalem, the brother Peter, the abbot of Cluny, wishes salvations and offers prayers.

Since the grace of the lord Jesus Christ established you as the priest of his Church, where he began the priesthood by the grace of the old and new law and where the Saviour, reconciling the world to God by his individual sacrifice, he wished that 

Not only I, but also the humble congregation of Cluny so greatly spread across all places of the earth, hopes, wishes and desires this also, as it is fitting.

your sanctity, ruling over such places of sanctityâ€¦
