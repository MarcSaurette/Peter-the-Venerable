# 147. to Ademar II, abbot of Figeac

To the venerable, beloved and loving lord Ademar, abbot of Figeac, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny, sense greeting and \(although injured\) nontheless sends sincere love.

I wrote once, I wrote a second time, first to one writing, then to one not writing. I marvel that nothing has been written by you to after my first letter, and nothing to the second. It is in no way possible to arise to one thinking a reason besides one. If you seek what I might think, I respond that you have not found a response to the objections. Which, if this is it, one thing remains, that is, the guilt to be confessed. Thence, at least should be the matter of rewriting, thence your letter is able to say to me: “I confess a fault, I request forgiveness.” And so that now I may undertake something earnestly, it is a good thing to not defer further to come to us, it is a good thing that we see you freely prepared. Do not let my complain dely your journey, since, as Salomon said, “it is a return to a friend.” I will expect your arrival, therefore, at Cluny or its environs either at Christmas or upon his epiphany…
