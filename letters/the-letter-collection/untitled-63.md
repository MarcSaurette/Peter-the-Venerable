# 112. to Pope Celestine \(1143\)

To the universal pontiff and the special father of the Cluniac church, the lord pope Celestine, brother Peter, humble abbot of the Cluniacs sends sincere love and complete obedience.

For I have every desire of coming to you, and of visiting one who is a new father but a friend ancient in love and owed honour; I will do this if I will be able to do so suitably.
