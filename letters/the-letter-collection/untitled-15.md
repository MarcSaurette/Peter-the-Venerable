# 69. to Hato, the Bishop of Troyes \(1138\)

To the venerable lord and intimate of us, Hato Bishop of Troyes, brother Peter, humble abbot of the Cluniacs sends greetings â€¦

I had sent the examples of them to Your Holiness but since he, about whom it is discussed, both showed himself and named himself our friend until now, love must not be harmed, which if it is, it will be made evident, if it is not, it will not lie hidden. On this account, I proposed to him to write and to prove one or the other of these. If he is a lover, he will put aside the quarrel with the grace of a friend; if he is not, he will not deal with you, but with us about these matters. It is not right that you feel any manner of annoyance without us concerning this matter, which you did not for you, not on account of you, but for us and on account of us. I myself will be your shield, on account of which so protected, either you will not feel or \(unless I run myself through\) you will be unable to feel the spears hurled by the enemy.
