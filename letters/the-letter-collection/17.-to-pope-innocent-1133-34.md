# 17. to Pope Innocent \(1133/34\)

We beseech therefore your Paternity that thus you may look to the peace and justice of it, such that it is possible to render to God what is God’s and to render to Caesar what is Caesar’s, if it able to be done so that it does not displease divine censure and does not offend royal majesty.
