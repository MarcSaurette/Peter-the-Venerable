# 116. to the lord Pope Lucius

To the Universal Pontiff and our particular father, the lord pope Lucius, the brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluniacs, pledge faithful obedience with sincere love.

Often have I made supplications, and still I do so, lest my frequent writings seem burdnesom by your reverence occupied by so many cares. For many things often emerge, which compell that I, not even willing, importune one attemting to flee this.

Therefore, let \[my\] testimony prevail above and overweigh \[that\] of such people for yourself, if it pleases, and let your wise judgement defend your bishop against the rare and men of an evil name, who, as it seems to me, more brandishing trumpets than hearing with their ears. Cohabitation has been chosen \(favoured\) for a long time now, by him and among his of a good, religious and singular man, which by the mandate of the lord pope Clestins, non indeed designated by name, but elected by us on account of the sign of religion, we gave to him in society.

May your sanctity always be strong in Christ.
