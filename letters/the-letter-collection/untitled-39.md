# 82. to the King of Jerusalem

To the glorious and magnificient king of the holy city of Jerusalem, brother Peter, the humble abbot of Cluny, wishes him to be saved by he who gave salvation to kings.

We give thanks to the omnipotent king of kings who raised up your Highness to the royal seat of king of His city of Jerusalem, and crowned you with a glorious diadem, who established you as prince to his people, as defender of his church, enemy to his enemies, in a city so great, so sacred, so noble, so renowned and which is greater than all things, he gave to you the insignia in his highest name. For since he had been called the King of Israel, the King of Jerusalem by the fathers, the prophets, the angels, the Jews, and the Gentiles, he wished you also to be king of his Jerusalem and even of Israel after him and for him in order that according to your person and the kingdom commited to you by Him, the rod of equity would be the sceptre of your kingdom, that you would love justice and hate iniquity, the enemies of the corss of Christ and of the Christian name \(I name the turks and Sarracens, the Persians and the Arabs, or even barbarians\). â€¦.

For what manfully ought be maintained, since we are not able with spears \(armis\) we attempt with spirits \(animis\); since we are not able with swords, as we are able, we suffice to give aid your bellicose exertions with prayers.
