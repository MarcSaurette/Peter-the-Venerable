# 48. to the Carthusians, in consolation of their dead brothers \(1122/37\)

To the most blessed and singularly honorable and named Carthusian lords and fathers, to the lord prior Guido and other brothers, brother Peter the humble abbot of the Cluniacs wishes eternal salvation from the most pious saviour Jesus Christ and to receive abundant consolation from the comforter of souls.

Having heard and scarcely believing it, I have been long stunned as if I was caught up in a trance, I must confess, my beloved, by the so sudden and unforeseen lessening of the apostolic number and of your celestial college. These things came to my mind and they insinuated themselves almost violently into my heart: on one side, the novelty of the matter, on the other, the abyss of the counselors of God; on one side in the sight of the Lord, the very precious manner of his saints, on the other the pain of his death out of human affection: who even if it was not owed to the deaths of the saints, nonetheless from the hearts of the loving, the very force of love was extorted. But, while I had grown silent, thinking by myself about these things for a few days, and sitting and mourning in the land as if with the friends of blessed Job, I decided to write to your love, more dear to me than gold and topaz and to know again the state of your soul by what means I was able.
