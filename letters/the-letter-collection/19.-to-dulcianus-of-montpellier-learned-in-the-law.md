# 19. to Dulcianus of Montpellier, learned in the Law

To the loved brother Theodard, the brother Peter, humble abbot of the Cluniacs sends good wishes.

Would that I be able to offer in words how greatly I conceive in my heart the affection of love towards you both formerly and especially recently. Surely Your Prudence recognized what he knows not, and he proved by the very experience of the things that he had obtained some kind of friendfor his services. 

â€¦

But if the many impediments drive perhaps you to delay this at present, at least a friendly soul does not deny this when I ask, that if not you, then at least another you, that is, one of your sons, may you both grant to and establish in God, by whom he admits him. If you will have made this gift to the Cluniac church by my hands, he will be a son to me, and, as I am confidant, you will merit to have God as father through him. About this which you will undertake, certify it as postponed by a messenger or a letter.
