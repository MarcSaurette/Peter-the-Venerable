# 65. to Bernard, abbot of Clairvaux \(1137\)

On which account, since, as an elected prelate, prepared in the time of conflict, you  make use of the right and the left hand against the dangers to the Church of God and since you disregard from the right hands and the left through the arms of justice, \[therefore\] I commit securely to you out of your friendship my messages which I sent to the lord Pope since you who assist in the cases of others, are not able to be absent from the affairs of your \[monks\].

How great the reverence, how great the love for you, my soul guards in its innermost parts; it knows what in you I revere and love. I do this, even though still your absence is concealing the \[unseen/ jealous?\] image of your body from me, since already reputation \(quicker than the body\) has born the countenance of your blessed soul to the eyes of my mind, such that it was able. And when I followed at length what had been denied for a long time, and the phantasms of dreams had vanished under the subsequent truth, my soul cleaved to you and was not able to be torn away further from your love. Your charity so overcame me wholly thereafter by it, your virtues and manners so seized me that they left nothing to me of myself which was not yours, they left nothing to you of yours which was not mine. Mutual charity abided in me constantly from that time and would that thusly it, begun for the sake of Christ, remain in you, which alone, since it is known to never die, well preserves its manner in me as much as it belongs to you. And since this is more precious than gold, brighter than any gem, I replace in my breast, I hide in the treasury what I received for so great a time no 

Indeed I give thanks because often through whatever salutations were sent, you have not entirely marked yourself forgetful of your friend. But I ask because you have not given up to this point more certain indications through letters. I say more certain since a letter is not known to change the imprinted speech, while the tongue of those speaking, by adding or deleting enjoinders change oftend the truth.
