# 123. A letter of Peter of Poitiers to Peter his abbot, then dwelling in the forest of Cluny

To the most beloved lord and father, Peter, his poorest servant, sends greetings.

Since the day of the glorious proto-martyr of the Apostles, my spirits feeling slightly raised through the mercy of God and by your prayers, I have not been able to be with you nor to say anything to you. With the help of Christ, I am prepared to fulfill \[the request\] of your wise men, if you command the lord claustral prior that he should supply the parchment. I rejoice not immoderately, I confess, at this unexpected command from you for me, which I will both be able to fulfill it with the Lord helping me and I desire to fulfill out of obedience, with the result that that, of course, I may be able to have done something out of obedience \[and\] finally show myself worthy of glory in your eyes.

I also must not keep silent about another matter: on the feast day of the most pious apostle Saint James at the hour when the solemnities of the major mass are undertaken, our brother Theobald brought your salutation to my unworthy self, and then my foot began to heal, such that, just as is said about the grace of the apostle, so is it about your prayer, I confess, receiving your salutation was the very thing that was salutary to me. Soon we shall see you safe in person, pious and most beloved father. Farewell to your co-hermits and all your companions who dwell with you in the woods.
