# 100. to the Clerics of Lyons \(1141\)

To our brothers to be loved and honoured, to lord abbot Ilion, to Archdeacon Stephen and to the whole chapter of the holy Church of Lyons, brother Peter, the humble abbot of the Cluniacs sends greetings.

The instruction of the apostle is, “Let us follow peace and holiness with all, without which none will see God.” And there is another of his commandments, “If it be possible, as much as in you, to have peace with all men.” Following these and like mandates of sacred law, I have for a long time endeavoured to take every effort in fraternal charity and peace, as my conscience attests. I do not consider that this conceals your love completely, since with the exception of last year’s discord, for almost twenty years now there has occurred no quarrel between the Cluniac church and the Lyonese church, no dispute, and no \(or little\) injury to the friendship in Christ uniting our hearts to each other.

Therefore I serve, and always do I endeavour to serve, the good of peace and concord between ours and yours.

“the unbreakable chain of this charity”

quarell arisen, and Innocent II them to not injure them. Therefore he is in the right and is asseting his dominance.
