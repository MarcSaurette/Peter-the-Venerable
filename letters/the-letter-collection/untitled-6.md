On account of this, I humbly bring up with your beloved and loveable paternity that the letter recently sent by you to me gravely wounded me, your son and the whole of \[our\] community, subject and devoted to you, since it exhibited things damaging to us and contrary to custom. I say, “they exhibited things damaging to us and contrary to custom” since they removed the tithe which, up to now, your church of Cluny received no differently than others for two hundred or more years, and rendered it undifferentiated from all.

Know therefore my heart…

Whence the universality of your sons beseach with repeated prayers, and I myself ask…
