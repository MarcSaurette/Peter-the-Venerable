# 2.11 How he maintained order most strictly when he was summoned by abbot Peter to Cluny

In fact, seeking with the greatest vigor all that which was trifling or superfluous in food, drink and manners and also what he had to suffer on account of that good of things which it is better to pass over in silence...

\[as bishop of Albano\] he conserved “both humility in his heart, and poverty in his dress”. Under no pretext of business which there were,  he did not abandon any of the exercises, any of the chants, any of the full Cluniac psalmody. He maintained the observances of the cloister in his palace and, while exposed to the world, he held himself removed from the vanities of the world, his intention with religion, having become inward by long and constant practice, providing for him as a inviolable enclosure.
