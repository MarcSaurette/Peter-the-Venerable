# The Plan

This project is at the very preliminary stages – I have thought about the need for greater access to Peter the Venerable and his writings for years, but am now starting to concepualize what it would look like in practice. The Gitbook/Github project pages represent my first stab at it – an initial upload of texts, translation and other resources that I have been working on for years and currently exist on my hard drive. Many of these texts have been sloppily translated for research
