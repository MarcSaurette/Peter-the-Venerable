# Epitaph of Pope Gelasius II

A grave man and wise in action, and with the word

Since first he was an Archdeacon of great action \(after being 

a monk\), and the chancellor of a city,

After being seized justly by the prelate Paschal for the stars

He merited after a time to ascend to the holy seat

to become, after the first, the worthy Gelasius II

But since he was raised, not at the order of a king,

The prince raged terribly and the sweet daughter

Gaul received the father like he was shipwrecked.

If it had been permitted to him \(certainly I believe\) under him, 

The virtue, and piety, and honesty would have increased;

And the peace of the Church blossom over the whole world. 

For shadowy death seized them man, when in the pontificate

Scarcely the venerable shepherd had done his first year.

He rested then two days, with Cluny

He sleeps in this special refuge of Roman law.

He therefore is placed among beloved fosterlings,

With the holy fathers he rests, and wishes that the creator 

And judge of the world might come powerfully at some time

And reform the fallen cinders into pristine members.

Always very happy, thence, you will abide at Cluny,

Because the Father of the world, both the highest and 

apostolic priest of the Church and of your special mother, 

before you he passed to the above, with the earth he rests in you.

No less now do we believe him happy

To whom pious Christ himself gave as a great gift,

That monks may look upon a monk, also a Father ceaselessly ??

And irrigating the tomb with tears

They always had special one in their sacred prayers.
