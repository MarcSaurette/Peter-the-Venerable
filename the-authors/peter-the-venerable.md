## Biography

[DLL \# A4986](https://catalog.digitallatin.org/dll-author/a4986)

In English, a useful starting point for researching  Peter the Venerable \(albeit rather dated at this point\) is Watkins Williams' chapter on [Peter the Venerable](https://books.google.ca/books?id=9OFRAQAAIAAJ&lpg=PA139&ots=qbOh4dqjCp&dq=Contra%20eos%20qui%20dicunt%20Christum%20nunquam%20se%20in%20Evangeliis%20aperte%20Deum%20dixisse&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q=Contra%20eos%20qui%20dicunt%20Christum%20nunquam%20se%20in%20Evangeliis%20aperte%20Deum%20dixisse&f=false) from the _Downside Review_ \(January 1936, vol. 54, no. 157, p. 1-17; later reprinted in his _Monastic Studies\)._ It provides an introductory overview of his life, family and writings. The references and editions it references, however, have largely been superceded by modern editions and translations.
