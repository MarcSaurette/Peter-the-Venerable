# The Team

The project is the child of Marc Saurette, medievalist at Carleton University \(Ottawa\), DH-wannabe and Cluny-phile. One day, he hopes to do some good, collaborative and useful, by encouraging access to the writings of Peter the Venarable. 

For more about Marc, see [one](https://hcommons.org/members/saurette/) of the many proliferating online profiles that seem to happen when you start working online. 

If you want to join in the fun, you can request to join the Slack at [thepetrusproject.slack.com](https://thepetrusproject.slack.com/) where "we" will be exchanging ideas on how to go about developing this collaborative project.
