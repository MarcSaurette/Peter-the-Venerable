# The Team

The project is the child of Marc Saurette, medievalist at Carleton University \(Ottawa\), DH-wannabe and Cluny-phile. One day, he hopes to do some good,collaborative and useful, by encouraging access to the writings of Peter the Venarable made available online and in modern languages. 

For more about him, see [one](https://hcommons.org/members/saurette/) of the many proliferating online profiles that seem to happen when you start working more and more online.
