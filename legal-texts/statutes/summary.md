## Summary

### **Dating**: 

1132    PV proposed these statutes at the general assembly of 1132 which brought together more than 200 priories and 1200 monks \[acc. to Odericus Vitalis\]

1136/7/8          Innocent II gives bull granting PV right to reform Cluniac monasteries; 29 January 1136.

1144   PV mentions a ‘great gathering of our monks” \(perhaps that year?\) \[cf. Letters, I, 293, 398\]

1146PV only promulgated them at the Chapter meeting in 1146 after getting the authorization to correct the way of monastic life from Innocent II,[\[1\]](applewebdata://F88B0DB7-4BDA-4418-8BBB-B69FE6444CE0#_ftn1). The dating arises from the prologue of the Statuta, in which Peter refers to his abbacy as having begun 24 years before in 1122 \(thus making the dating ca. 1146/7\).

1148A second document followed in 1148, Dispositio rei familiaris Cluniacensis\(PL189, col. 1047-54\). 

The De miraculis also provides an account of another attempt to implement the reform, which was undertaken by Matthew of Albano. \[This text begun august 1135, later added to in 1142/ 1143\]. 

Acc. to Knowles there is no indication of the relation of the 1132 decrees to the Statuta. “Retour” suggests they are the same.

The dating of some of the statutes show they were composed earlier, some later. St. 19 was issued while work on the church was still in progress, which was consecrated by Innocent II in 1130 \[though this may not mean that it was finished then\]; Statute 61 refers to a pratice only instituted in St. 25. And Statutes 63-76 might be something else, given that Peter seems to sum up stuff in Stat. 62, and the latter statutes seem to repeat what comes at the beginning. These last 14 only exist in one manuscript, added to the first recension of the text. The causae might also be added only when they were collected together.The single statute surviving outside the collection, or the specific application of St. 44 found in the cartulary of Longpoint \[cf. Le cartulaire du prieuré de Notre-Dame de Longpoint. \(Lyon, 1879\): 69-70.\] has a causa. \[taken from Statuta Petri Venerabilis, 22-24\]

### **Description**: 

introduces modifications, addresses abuses, clarifies points of the RB. Offers both statuta and the reason for its modification. Acc. to PV, there is eternal and human law, the second is changeable: ie. fasts, vigils, manual labour, corporal penitence. PV emphasizes that popes and his predecessors have changed custom from necessity or for rationality. Basis in moderation.  It is also a justification \(I believe\) for the future, to defend his changes and ensure their complete incorporation. I think, moreover, that the reasons he uses to justify changes are political- justifications that all would accept- which hide his desire to implement ideological changes \(ex. Stat. 55\)

-76 + 2 statuta in total: celebration of divine office \(9\); penitence/ abstinence \(6\); silence \(5\); reception \(5\); infirmary \(4\); recruitment \(4\); charity \(2\); servants \(1\); nuns \(1\).

**A. Prologue**: PV offers a long justification for making changes; changes made not according to his will/ desire, but following the precepts of the RB, the opinion of senioresand with the assent of the entire chapter general.

**B.   Liturgy**: \(20\) •matins and vespers must always be celebrated on domincal days •simplified some offices, suppressed psalms, established new readings, new chants, imposed the recitation of the credo. •established a marial cult \(daily mass for mary\) • imposed a feast of the Transfiguration, the inventioof the Holy Cross •liturgy for the dead \(new vigils\), to limit acts of mercy on account of dead. •harmonization of chant and silence •prohibition of private masses during conventual mass •when all candles are to be lit

**C.  Order and Discipline**: •restraint in eating/ drinking •emphasis on silence •simplicity in clothing •suppression of no longer significant customs: shoe washing, the siesta •recruitment: habit not before 20, priest not before 25

Constable suggests that from letter 150 \(refering to a decision concerning the reception of Cistercian monks in Cluniac houses\), it can be seen that the list of statutes is incomplete.

 Constable \(intro to Stat., p. 24\) refers to customs, as “not simply what had been done for a certain length of time, but what had been properly done. Thus in the causaof Statute 72 he spoke of an abuse which has already changed into custom in such a way that people think it is a custom. Constable suggests that novelty could correct unworthy custom, because by definition proper custom would not need to be changed.
