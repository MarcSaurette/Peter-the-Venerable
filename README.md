# The Petrus Project

## The Goal

Despite being one of the pre-eminent churchman and prolific authors of the twelfth-century, scholarly work or public interest in Peter the Venerable has traditionally remained low due to the inaccessibility of his writings. The goal of this project is to make accessible on-going \(draft\) translations of Peter's writings in order to begin this work. 

{% hint style="info" %}
 This project is currently the baby of Marc Saurette \(marc.saurette@carleton.ca\) who hopes to turn it into a wider collaboration of scholars.
